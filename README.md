- 👋 Hi, I’m Iury Mota
- 👀 I’m interested in mostly development areas and cycles such as backend, data, database administration and devops.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cloud development, using java with spring boot for developing solutions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are compromised with good practices and learning new things through the whole software lifecycle.
- 📫 You can reach me through email: iury.damasceno.mota@gmail.com and through linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/iurydamascenodev/.
